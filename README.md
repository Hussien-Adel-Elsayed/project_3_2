# Bank Clients Management System (Version 2.0)
This is an updated and expanded version of the C++ Console Application for bank client management.

Version 2.0 introduces a dedicated Transactions Menu and implements core financial functionalities, such as Depositing and Withdrawing funds. Crucially, this expansion was achieved by leveraging the existing modular and scalable architecture, adding new features with minimal modification to the established client management (CRUD) core.

üéØ New Features in V2.0 (Transactions)
Feature	Description
Deposit:	Allows users to deposit a specified amount into a client's account, instantly updating the balance.
Withdraw:	Allows users to withdraw funds, with validation to ensure the withdrawal amount does not exceed the current account balance.
Total Balances:	Displays a comprehensive list of all clients, showing only their Account Number, Name, and current Balance, along with the Total Aggregate Balance for the entire bank.
Transactions Menu:	A dedicated menu structure to organize and access all financial operations, separate from the core client management functions.

‚öôÔ∏è Core Functionality (CRUD Management)
The essential client management operations remain fully functional:

List All Clients

Add New Client

Delete Client

Update Client Info

Find Client

üèóÔ∏è Architecture: Seamless Expansion & Scalability
A key strength of this project is its design approach:

The system was not rewritten from scratch. The addition of the Transactions Menu and its features (Deposit, Withdraw) was implemented by extending the existing code's solid foundation.

Modular Design: The separation of concerns in the initial design allowed us to introduce new functionalities (ShowDepositScreen, ShowWithdrawScreen, DepositBalanceToClientByAccountNumber) that integrate smoothly with the existing file reading/writing and client finding logic.

Efficiency in Development: By having a well-defined sClient structure and robust data persistence functions (SaveClientsDataToFile), we only had to focus on the new business logic for transactions, proving the initial design was truly scalable.

Future Proofing: The updated structure maintains its high modularity, making it even easier to introduce more complex features down the line, such as funds transfer between accounts or generating transaction reports.

üíª How to Run (Same as V1.0)
Compile the C++ source code.

Run the executable file.

The program will open the Main Menu, where you can access the core client management features or navigate to the new Transactions Menu option.
